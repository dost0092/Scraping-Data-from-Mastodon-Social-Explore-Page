The process involves scrolling through the page to load more content and then parsing the HTML to extract text. Here’s how it’s done:

## Extracting Video Links
Finally, Mastodon also features videos that users can upload and share. With Selenium, we can locate video elements on the page and extract their URLs. Here’s an overview of the process:

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we’ve explored the process of scraping various types of data from the Mastodon Social Explore page. Using a combination of Selenium and BeautifulSoup, we can efficiently gather images, audio files, text content, and video links. These techniques can be adapted and expanded to scrape data from other social media platforms and websites.
